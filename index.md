# Certificate in Teaching College Science and Mathematics

During my Ph.D., I am also earning a [Certificate in Teaching College Science and Mathematics](https://natsci.msu.edu/students/future-students/graduate/certification-in-teaching/). This certificate requires the fulfillment of five **core competency** areas related to teaching higher education:

1. Developing Discipline-Related Teaching Strategies
2. Creating Effective Learning Environments
3. Incorporating Effective Learning Environments
