# Certificate in Teaching College Science and Mathematics

During my Ph.D., I am also earning a [Certificate in Teaching College Science and Mathematics](https://natsci.msu.edu/students/future-students/graduate/certification-in-teaching/). This certificate requires the fulfillment of five **core competency** areas related to teaching higher education:

1. Developing Discipline-Related Teaching Strategies
2. Creating Effective Learning Environments
3. Incorporating Effective Learning Environments
4. Understanding the University Context
5. Assessing Student Learning

In addition, participants complete a **mentored teaching project** and a **teaching portfolio**.

The purpose of this page is to keep track of and display my progress towards the certificate.

**Workshop/Program**: College Online Learning Academy

### Description 

_From [2021 COLA Fellows Program site](https://cola.msu.hcommons.org/):_ The Colleges’ Online Learning Academy (COLA) program is a summer fellowship that allows graduate students to more deeply engage with digital teaching and learning in their work. The fellowship provides opportunities for professional development, networking, and mentorship, deep dives into aspects of teaching, and opportunities for peer review and to reflect on teaching practice.

For my COLA project, I am creating an accessibility rubric for instructors to use for self-assessment of their online courses. 

### Artifact

The rubric is currently under construction; it will be here upon completion!

### Artifact Rationale

An accessibility rubric gives instructors and course designers a framework for inclusive course design as it relates to the incorporation of technology into their courses. In creating creating a rubric to help other instructors assess the accessibility of their online courses, I have dug into the literature on effectively incorporating technology into teaching and put that literature into practice via self-assessment.

### Interpretation/Reflection

To be done upon completion of COLA fellowship in August.
